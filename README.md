# MATLAB Tools PERFORM3D (matp3d)

This project aims to provide MATLAB tools to extract and plot the results and other relevant data from one or multiple PERFORM3D model(s).

## Getting Started

There are several parts of the program:

* Setting up the naming convention of the parameters
* Getting data from the PERFORM3D models and saving them to MATLAB ".mat" files
* Plotting the results

### Prerequisites

The functions are developed using MATLAB 2017b. No specific package is needed.

### Setting Up the Folder Structure

For program to work properly, PERFORM3D models should be placed in one folder.
